Terminology is important here. Asynchronous processing isn’t equal to non-blocking I/O. Asynchronous processing means that a servlet container’s thread delegates processing to another worker thread. Non-blocking I/O means that the worker thread isn’t waiting for an external resource. Asynchronous processing can either use blocking I/O (e.g. synchronous call to JDBC) or non-blocking I/O (e.g. JMS event listener).
